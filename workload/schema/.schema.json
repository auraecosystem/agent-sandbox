The consumer contract is file-based: the workload must read each value from its /run/secrets path. Values may contain newlines and are delivered byte-exact; the tmpfs caps total secret material at 1 MiB. Names must be env-var-shaped; the name pattern ends in (?![\\s\\S]) rather than $ because a name is an in-container path component and Python's re lets a plain $ match before a string-final newline."
